    "(i) Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to describe or summarize data. They include measures such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: A research team collects data on the heights of a group of people in a particular region. They calculate the mean height, median height, and standard deviation of the group to describe the distribution of heights.\n",

    "(ii) Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. They include methods such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: A pharmaceutical company wants to know if a new drug is effective in reducing symptoms of a certain disease. They conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to determine if the results of the trial can be generalized to the larger population of patients with the disease.\n"

    "\n",
    "---> Understanding the level of measurement is important when analyzing data because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be performed on the data, as well as the appropriate measures of central tendency and variability to use. In addition, the level of measurement affects the types of conclusions that can be drawn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a researcher conducts a survey of students at a university, asking them to rate their level of satisfaction with various aspects of their experience on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is very dissatisfied and 10 is very satisfied. The satisfaction rating is an ordinal variable because it has a natural order and ranking, but the difference between each rating is not necessarily equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the researcher wants to summarize the overall satisfaction level of the students, they might report the median or mode of the satisfaction ratings. However, they cannot report the mean, as the mean is not appropriate for ordinal data because it assumes equal intervals between each rating. If the researcher reports the mean, they may draw incorrect conclusions about the level of satisfaction among the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if the researcher wants to compare the satisfaction levels across different groups of students, such as males versus females, they would need to use a non-parametric test, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, rather than a t-test, which assumes that the data are normally distributed and have equal variances. If the researcher mistakenly assumed that the satisfaction rating was an interval variable, they might use a t-test, which would not be appropriate for ordinal data.\n",

    "In summary, understanding the level of measurement is critical for accurately analyzing and interpreting data, and can prevent drawing incorrect conclusions from the data.\n"
